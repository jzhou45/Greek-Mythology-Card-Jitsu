  "description": "## Background Card-Jitsu is a mini-game that was first introduced in the formerly popular MMORPG, Club Penguin, in November of 2008, with the introduction of ninjas and the Dojo to servers. The card game follows a simple gameplay premise, where players would have decks with cards of three different types, that follow the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors structure, where 1 type would beat another, but lose to the other. The cards would also contain a number value and color associated with it for additional gameplay mechanics, along with cards with special effect that changes the rules of the round it's played in.",
