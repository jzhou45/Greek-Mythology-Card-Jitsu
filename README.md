# Greek Mythology Card-Jitsu

## Background
Card-Jitsu is a mini-game that was first introduced in the formerly popular MMORPG, Club Penguin, in November of 2008, with the introduction of ninjas and the Dojo to servers. The card game follows a simple gameplay premise, where players would have decks with cards of three different types, that follow the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors structure, where 1 type would beat another, but lose to the other. The cards would also contain a number value and color associated with it for additional gameplay mechanics, along with cards with special effect that changes the rules of the round it's played in.

Each round of Card-Jitsu, would require each player to play 1 card at the same time. The player with the strong type would win the round, e.g. Water beats Fire in Card-Jitsu or Rock beats Scissors in Rock-Paper-Scissors. If both cards are of the same element, the card with the higher number value would win, otherwise the round will end in a tie.

After each round ends, the player would collect a token with the type and color of the card they won with. In order to win the game, a player would need to collect 3 tokens are different types or 3 tokens of the same type with different colors.

This game will aim to recreate the same game mechanics, involving cards based on Greek mythology.
